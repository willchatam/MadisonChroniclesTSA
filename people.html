    <p>There are many influencial people who made Madison the thriving city it is today. But first, we need to go back to before the establishment of Madison City, when the first American/European settlers arrived at this land.</p>
    <h2>John Cartwright</h1>
    <p>In 1818, John Cartwright became the first person to settle in Madison. He went to the Tennessee Valley and liked what he saw of the land, and recieved a grant for land there. That land would later be named Madison Station, and then just Madison.</p>
    <h4 class="funfact">Fun Fact: John's younger brother, Edmund Cartwright, invented the power loom.</h4>
    <p>But while John definitely provided a base on where Madison would be today, it's time to take a look at a special man who helped make Madison a town and a place on the map, James Clemens.</p>
    <h2>James Clemens</h1>
    <p>Judge James Clemens, also known as "The Founder of Madison", was born in 1778 in Pennsylvania. He first came to the Huntsville area in 1812 and started a mercantile business there. After a few years, Clemens's business parter left Huntsville, but Clemens's business continued to thrive.</p>
    <p>But in 1854, Judge Clemens revolutionized the land that would soon become Madison Station at a very fast pace. He purchased land from the government (which was originally going to be used for schools) and turned that land into a railroad depot, between Huntsville and Decatur.</p>
    <p>Clemens's goal for this land was to make it into a railroad station, hence why he transformed that land into a train depot. He wanted to name this station Clemens Depot, but when the railroad was drawing the town on their maps they labeled the town Madison Station, which is how Madison acquired it's name today. The cause of this renaming is unknown.</p>
    <h4 class="funfact">Fun Fact: Years after James's death and the establishment of Madison, James Clemens had a highschool named after him in 2012.</h4>
    <h4 class="funfact">Fun Fact: James's cousin, Samuel Langhorne Clemens, grew to be a very famous comedic writer, who went under the name Mark Twain.</h4>
    <h2>James H. Bibb</h2>
    <p>While James Bibb wasn't as influencial as John Cartwright or James Clemens, Bibb was still very important during the birth of Madison and often worked along with James Clemens.</p>
    <p>James Henry Bibb was born in 1826 to James Bibb senior and Sally Alford. James senior worked as a tax collector and assessor.</p>
    <p>James Bibb junior was certainly impactful and one of the leading founders of Madison, but was most known for being a very successful businessman. He owned a storehouse on Main Street which was close to Sarah Clay's house, which would turn into the Clay House Museum.</p>
    <p>Bibb's house is still standing today, known as the Bibb-Whatley house and built in 1867. The house one of the oldest houses in Madison and is a little west of the historical district. The Bibb-Whatley house is located at 11 Allen Street.</p>
    <h4 class="funfact">Fun Fact: James Bibb was related to the first two governors of Alabama, William Wyatt and Thomas Bibb. They are all descended from Benjamin Bibb, who lived in 1600s colonial Virginia.</h4>
    <h4 class="funfact">Fun Fact: Bibb was one of the main people who decided to drop the "Station" in Madison Station and rename it to Madison.</h4>
    <p>Another very important individual in Madison's beginning was William R. Johnston, who was the first mayor.</p>
    <h2>William Johnston</h2>
    <p>William R. Johnston lived in what would soon be Madison Station in his childhood. His father bought 240 acres of land in Madison, so Johnston grew up in an upper-class family. When he was an adult, he married a woman named Sarah and had three kids; Elizabet, William C., and Maud. In 1870, William's job was labeled as being a "retail dry goods merchant".</p>
    <p>Johnston bought 4 pieces of land in Madison, including what would be The Post Office Lot, which is the oldest post office building in Madison and is displayed in many books about the history of Madison.</p>
    <p>But Johnston's main achievement was how he became the first mayor of Madison Station. He took office in 1869, but his term was cut short when Thomas J. Clay became the second mayor of Madison in 1870.</p>
    <h4 class="funfact">Fun Fact: The first two mayors of Madison, William Johnston and Thomas Clay, both had connections to the post office before taking office.</h4>
    <h2>Thomas Clay</h2>
    <p>Thomas J. Clay was the second mayor of Madison after William R. Johnston, and served in office from 1870 to 1877. Before becoming mayor, Clay was the first postmaster in Madison. Even though Johnston owned the post office, Clay's relatives actually lived extremely close by the building.</p>
