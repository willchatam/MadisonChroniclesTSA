            <h2>William Johnston</h2>
            <p>William R. Johnston lived in what would soon be Madison Station in his childhood. His father bought 240 acres of land in Madison, so Johnston grew up in an upper-class family. When he was an adult, he married a woman named Sarah and had three kids; Elizabet, William C., and Maud. In 1870, William's job was labeled as being a "retail dry goods merchant".</p>
            <p>Johnston bought 4 pieces of land in Madison, including what would be The Post Office Lot, which is the oldest post office building in Madison and is displayed in many books about the history of Madison.</p>
            <p>But Johnston's main achievement was how he became the first mayor of Madison Station. He took office in 1869, but his term was cut short when Thomas J. Clay became the second mayor of Madison in 1870.</p>
            <p class="funfact">Fun Fact: The first two mayors of Madison, William Johnston and Thomas Clay, both had connections to the post office before becoming mayors.</p>
