            <h2>James Clemens</h1>
            <p>Judge James Clemens, also known as "The Founder of Madison", was born in 1778 in Pennsylvania. He first came to the Huntsville area in 1812 and started a mercantile business there. After a few years, Clemens's business parter left Huntsville, but Clemens's business continued to thrive.</p>
            <p>But in 1854, Judge Clemens revolutionized the land that would soon become Madison Station at a very fast pace. He purchased land from the government (which was originally going to be used for schools) and turned that land into a railroad depot, between Huntsville and Decatur.</p>
            <p>Clemens's goal for this land was to make it into a railroad station, hence why he transformed that land into a train depot. He wanted to name this station Clemens Depot, but when the railroad was drawing the town on their maps they labeled the town Madison Station, which is how Madison acquired it's name today. The cause of this renaming is unknown.</p>
            <p class="funfact">Fun Fact: Years after James's death and the establishment of Madison, James Clemens had a highschool named after him in 2012.</p>
            <p class="funfact">Fun Fact: James's cousin, Samuel Langhorne Clemens, grew to be a very famous comedic writer, who went under the name Mark Twain.</p>
